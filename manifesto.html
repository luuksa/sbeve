		<h1>Our plan to save all the Steves!</h1>
		<p>In order to save as many lives we have partnered with NordBMP! NordBMP is the leading manifacturer of infantry fighting vehicles. Please support us by buying your very own BMP!</p>
		<p>We belive that every Steve is worthy of help and that's what we've been doing since 1912. There are many Steves who live perfectly fine withou electricity and that has to change! To change this horrific injustice we are providing gasoline powered generators to <u>every</u> steve above the age of five!</p>
